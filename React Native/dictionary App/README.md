This is a project that I started with a fellow art school student while in the military. Many of our colleagues had difficulty learning English and were unable to read books they wanted to read because they were written in English. So, I asked my art school friend to design a UI/UX and we created a dictionary app. I developed the app using React Native cross-platform, and when a user uploads a PDF book, it parses all the words and loads their meanings using a dictionary API. When the user comes across an unfamiliar word while reading, they can click on the word and a pop-up appears with the definition and examples, helping the user with their reading. Users can also add words to their vocabulary list and take random pop quizzes. If they get the same word correct three times, it is moved to a completed vocabulary list. It was a dictionary app with these features.
